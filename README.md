# Good Doctor (Joseph Edit)

Is a mod originally by Spammer21, edited by JosephMcKean. 

## Difference between this version and [the original one](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51503)? 

Original: 
- Not compatible with No Disease Label.
- Can only pacify creatures whose name has "Diseased" or "Blighted" in it, modded or not.
- There's also a slight chance for them to start following you for a short time if they like you enough.

Joseph Edit:
- Compatible with No Disease Label.
- In theory, you can pacify every creature in your game but the default config if only for the two domestic animals guar and shalk. Users need to config themselves if they want to be able to pacify other creatures. (See the end of the readme for further instructions)
- Creatures won't follow you after being cured.

## How to config creatures to allow them to be pacified?

If you want this mod to function similarly to the original mod, you will need to add more creature to the tables in config file. I have created an alternative config json file for people who want to pacify **vanilla** diseased and blighted creatures. So just copy `..\Data Files\MWSE\mods\Spammer\Good Doctor\alternativeConfig\Good Doctor (Joseph Edit).json` to `..\Data Files\MWSE\config\`. If you launch the game and go into the Mod Config Menu of this mod, more creatures like `alit_diseased` should show up in the left panel of exclusion page Pacified by Cure Common Disease. 

If you still have questions, open an issue or ask me (@JosephMcKean) in Morrowind Modding Discord.
